This bot:
- **Fetches Real-Time News**: Pulls the latest market news from [Livemint](https://www.livemint.com) and [Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com)
- **Intelligent Curation**: Uses AI (Llama 3.3 70B via Groq) to analyze and organize news into categories:
  - 🏦 Banking & Finance
  - 💻 IT & Technology  
  - 📈 FII Flows & Macro
- **Automated Delivery**: Sends a beautifully formatted daily report to your Telegram chat
- **Error Handling**: Notifies you immediately if anything goes wrong

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- A Telegram account
- A Groq API key (free at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com))

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/archanani/PersonalNewsBot.git
   cd market_news_agent
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
   CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id_here
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Get your Telegram credentials**
   - **Bot Token**: Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
   - **Chat ID**: Send a message to your bot, then visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` to find your chat ID

6. **Run the bot**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📋 How It Works

1. The bot initializes a LangChain agent with the Llama 3.3 70B model
2. It fetches the latest market news from RSS feeds of Livemint and Economic Times
3. The AI agent organizes the news into relevant financial categories
4. It formats the news with proper HTML styling for Telegram
5. Sends the formatted report to your Telegram chat
6. If any errors occur, you get notified via Telegram

## 🛠️ Customization

### Change News Sources
Edit the `fetch_indian_market_rss()` function in `main.py`:
```python
rss_urls = [
    "http://livemint.com/rss/markets",
    "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/rssfeeds/1977021501.cms",
    # Add more RSS feeds here
]
```

### Modify Report Categories
Update the system prompt in the `prompt` variable:
```python
"2. Organize results into: 🏦 BANKING, 💻 IT & TECH, 📈 FII/MACRO.\n"
```

### Change AI Model
Update the model in `main.py`:
```python
llm = ChatGroq(model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile", temperature=0)
```

## 📊 Current Limitations

- **Single Timezone**: Currently hardcoded for IST (India Standard Time). No timezone flexibility
- **Indian Markets Only**: Focused exclusively on Indian financial news sources (Livemint, ET)
- **Manual Local Setup**: Requires manual environment variable configuration for local runs
- **No Database/History**: Doesn't store historical news or reports - each run is independent
- **Limited News Sources**: Only 2 RSS feeds. Doesn't include other financial sources or APIs
- **No Error Retry Logic**: If a news fetch fails, it doesn't retry or fallback gracefully
- **No User Customization**: All users get the same categories and formatting
- **Telegram Only**: Output is limited to Telegram - no other notification channels
- **No Rate Limiting**: Could hit API rate limits if run too frequently
- **No Content Filtering**: Sometimes publishes promotional or low-quality content without filtering
- **Static Categories**: Fixed category organization doesn't adapt to market conditions
